# Task_07_Decision_Making

Research Task 7: Ethical Implications of Decision Making
This task transformed the data narrative into a Stakeholder Decision Report, with a strong focus on ethical analysis, statistical uncertainty, and full process auditability. The core goal was to ensure AI-driven recommendations are safe, responsible, and statistically justifiable before being presented to a Head Coach or Athletic Director.

Task 7 Workflow: Data-to-Ethics Pipeline
The following steps document the move from the raw interview script to the final, high-stakes decision report.

1. Define Context and Risk Assessment
Action: Explicitly defined the stakeholders (Head Coach/AD) and the Decision Context (strategic resource allocation for the next season).

Artifact: Created Task context to formally assign a High Risk level to the decisions (personnel, budget).

2. Document Data Provenance and Scope
Action: Established the assumed source of the statistics (Internal Athletics Analytics).

Artifact: Created data provenance to summarize the data lineage, identify privacy concerns (minimal), and flag the Clearing Efficiency metric (.871 vs .893) as having High Uncertainty due to lack of standard deviation.

3. Statistical Validation and Uncertainty Quantification
Action: Wrote a validation script to test the core claims of the LLM narrative against the raw data points.

Calculated the real-world impact of the two primary recommendations:

Clearing: Showed a marginal loss of ≈0.55 possessions per game.

Faceoffs (Mason Kohn): Demonstrated that a modest 5% improvement in FO efficiency would yield ≈1.5 possessions per game (a 3× higher statistical return).

Finding: This step revealed that the LLM's suggested focus (Clearing) had lower statistical leverage than the secondary player-based recommendation (Faceoffs).

4. LLM Prompt Capture and Verification Transcript
Action: Documented the process of generating and editing the original interview lines.

Artifact: Captured a simulated raw LLM output and used an annotated version to explicitly track where subjective, hallucinated claims (ex: "massive structural breakdown in the fourth quarter") were removed or softened to comply with the rules.

5. Tiered Recommendation and Ethical Analysis
Action: Structured the recommendations based on the findings from the statistical validation (Step 3).

Operational (Low Risk): Clearing (low statistical leverage).

Investigatory (Medium Risk): Investing in the high-leverage player (Kohn, FO%).

High-Stakes (High Risk): Potential personnel review/recruitment.

Ethical Review: Analyzed the Investigatory recommendation, noting the ethical risk of creating undue pressure on a single player, and added specific mitigation strategies (framing as an investment, providing support).

6. Final Stakeholder Report Generation
Action: Generated the final report using clear, non-technical language appropriate for an Athletic Director.

Artifact: Included all mandatory components:

An Explicit Uncertainty Statement.

Tiered Recommendations (Operational, Investigatory, High-Stakes).

A dedicated section on Ethical/Legal Concerns.

Clear labeling of all LLM-generated text (Appended in the report).
